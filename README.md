This project was written originally for a school project while I was at Bunker Hill Community College, and
expanded on the summer after. It features 3 player classes with unique moves and stats, enemies which
have unique weaknesses and strengths, level scaling, and many typical RPG features. This project is old,
but I'm very proud of it and anyone who wants to build off it or learn from it is more than welcome.

Overall this project really showcases the power of object-oriented design and the ease of using
polymorphism to develop large and complicated programs (which all games are) and organising a
project so that is easier to build from the ground up. 

While making this game, I learned how difficult it can be to balance the game for the player -
this shows you must always put yourself in the shoes of the customer when you develop! Always
consider that point of view during every step.
